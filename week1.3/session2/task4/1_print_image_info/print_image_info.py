# Week 1.3, Session 2: Print PGM image info

# Open a pgm image file
# You can use the relative path ../images/filename
# You could handle file errors with try/except.

# Read the file content
with open("../images/feep.pgm", "r") as f:
    data = f.readlines()
data = [line.strip().split(",") for line in data ]
print(data)

Dimensions = data[1][0].split(" ")

MaxGray = data[2][0]
# print image dimension (i.e., Dimensions: width x height pixels)
print(f"Dimensions: {Dimensions[0]} x {Dimensions[1]}, max grey value: {MaxGray}")
# print max gray value (i.e., Max Gray Value: max_gray_value)
